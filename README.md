# Prosper-Loan
Its a Python Prosper Loan Project used numpy , pandas ,mathloplib ,seaborn libraries.I have used diffrent method to clean the data in the dataset as well.
Prosper is an online lending marketplace that offers personal loans, home equity loans, credit cards and more.This dataset includes customers who have paid off their loans, who have been past due and put into collection without paying back their loan and interests, and who have paid off only after they were put in collection. The original dataset contains 113937 rows and 81 columns out of which 49 features of interest were selected.Rest other columns in which data was mising or inconsisitencies is removed.


What is the structure of your dataset?
Used pandas data structures are the Series and the DataFrame.In a simple word, a Series is similar to a single column of data while a DataFrame is similar to a sheet with rows and columns.

What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
Main Features of Dataset is Borrwer rate,Loan losses,Loan duration and Income range.

What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
Features helped me to support my investigation was Borrower rate and the Income group ,Occupation and Employement Status.

Data Cleaning before Visualization

Conclusions
The data exploration and visualization process involved several steps, including cleaning the data, exploring the distributions of various features, and examining the relationships between different features. The visualizations used included scatterplots, barcharts, and histograms, among others. By visualizing the data in various ways, it was possible to identify patterns and relationships that were not immediately apparent from just looking at the raw data.

The data exploration process helped to uncover important insights into the data and provide a better understanding of the relationships between different features. These findings can be used to guide further analysis and potentially inform business decisions related to loan management and risk assessment.
